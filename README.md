# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Network

This project implements a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes a Python script for training the network and a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive digit recognition.

# How to use 
- Train model using scrit.py
  ```bash
  python script.py
- Run the Program using gui.py
  ```bash
  python python gui.py

## Features

- **Neural Network Training**: Train a neural network on the MNIST dataset with customizable parameters.
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly interface to draw digits and get real-time recognition results.
- **Save and Load Drawings**: Save your drawings as images or load existing images for recognition.
- **Confidence Visualization**: Visualize the network's confidence levels for each digit (0-9).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `Pillow`, `scipy`, `tkinter`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy Pillow scipy tk
